# MultipleFacesRecognition

This Application detects multiple faces in a image,
To Detect Multiple Faces I used Clarifai API which is free face detection API
I also Used Particle.Js In the Front End.

This Application is made by using PERN stack
where front-end is built in ReactJS and Back-end is built in NodeJs and For Database PostGreSql is used.

To Run this Project,
Just Download this project
Install all the dependencies by <strong>npm install</strong> then <strong>npm start</strong> to run this project
Run Both Frontend and Backend in seperate console(install Both Dependencies seperately)
First run Backend then run Front end
You need to have PostGreSql installed in your system.
After installing PostGreSql i recommend you to install TeamSql which is a GUI of PostGreSql.
Then Create Database and Tables as mentioned in database.txt

Also You need Clarifai API Key which you can get for free
Just Go to clarafai Api website and signup you will get API Key
