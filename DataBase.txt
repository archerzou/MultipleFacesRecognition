You need PostGreSql installed in your system.
After installing PostGreSql i recommend you to install TeamSql which is a GUI of PostGreSql.

Once You Installed TeamSql just create new connection
Name your database whatever you want.

Then just create 2 tables 'users' and 'login'
By following sql code:-

CREATE TABLE users (
    id serial PRIMARY key,
    name varchar(100),
    email text UNIQUE NOT null,
    entries BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    joined TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE login (
    id serial PRIMARY key,
    hash VARCHAR(100) NOT null,
    email text UNIQUE NOT NULL
)
